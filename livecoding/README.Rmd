## Overview

`livecoding` is an R package designed to facilitate real-time live coding sessions directly within RStudio. It allows a broadcaster to share their code changes instantly via a GitHub Gist, while participants can join and follow along in their own RStudio sessions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `livecoding` from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Estacion-R/estacion-r-streaming/livecoding")
```

## Usage

### Broadcasting a Session

To start a live coding session, open the R script you wish to broadcast in RStudio and run the `livecode()` function:

```r
# Broadcast the currently active RStudio source file.
livecoding::livecode()
# Run `livecoding::join("session_id_here")`.
```

This will create a new GitHub Gist and print a command for participants to join your session.

### Joining a Session

If you are a participant, you can join a live coding session using the `join()` function, providing the broadcaster's session ID:

```r
# Example: Join a session where 'session_id_here' is the ID of the shared live coding session.
livecoding::join(session_id = "session_id_here")
```

Your RStudio session will then automatically update with the broadcaster's code changes.

## Setup: GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

To broadcast a session (using `livecode()`), you need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `gist` scope. It is recommended to set this as an environment variable named `GITHUB_PAT`. You can add the following line to your `~/.Renviron` file (and restart R):

```
GITHUB_PAT="YOUR_GITHUB_PAT_HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PAT_HERE` with your actual PAT.
